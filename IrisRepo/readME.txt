A small classic dataset from Fisher, 1936. One of the earliest known datasets used for evaluating classification methods.

Dataset Information
What do the instances in this dataset represent?

Each instance is a plant

Additional Information

This is one of the earliest datasets used in the literature on classification methods and widely used in statistics and machine learning.  The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant.  One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are not linearly separable from each other.
